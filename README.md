# project
I worked on my first front end project(google landingpage)
To hone my skills, and I would say it was worth while.
I learnt things and also with the help of other projects and google 
I was able to finish it.

# skills
HTML and CSS was what I used to write my code
HTML for the structuring and CSS to give it life
